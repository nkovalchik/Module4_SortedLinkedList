# Module4_SortedLinkedList
Reads a list of integers from user input, stores them in a LinkedList, sorts them in ascending order, and prints the sorted list. Instead of creating sorting logic in main where it could not be used I created a method in class for reusability.  Now whenever you want to sort numbers inputted by a user you can just call function.
